## AngularJS-TypeScript-Sample
This project is a so simple sample using AngularJS, TypeScript and webpack.
This project was created by the following procedure.

```bash 
npm init -y
npm install --save angular
npm install --save-dev @types/angular
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin html-loader
```
After this, I created webpack.config.js, tsconfig.json, src/index.html, and src/index.ts.

## Usage 
```bash 
# installation
npm install

# running
npm run start

# building
npm run build
```
